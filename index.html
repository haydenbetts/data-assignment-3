                        NYCHA's long-term capital needs are set to rise dramatically across New York City, with some districts facing increases of over 140% between 5-year and 20-year projections, according to new data from the housing authority's capital needs assessment.

                    <p>
                        The sharpest increases are concentrated in Northeast Queens, where District 19's capital needs are projected to jump from $4.3 million to $10.4 million - a 142% surge. Meanwhile, some of NYCHA's largest developments in districts like East Harlem (District 8) and the South Bronx (District 16) already require billions in immediate repairs.

                        "These not surprising to those of us living in NYCHA developments," said Danny Barber, Chair of NYCHA's Citywide Council of Presidents and a Jackson Houses resident, after reviewing the data. "When you look at the map, you can see how the need for investment compounds over time."
